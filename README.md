  abstract = {Joy Bergelson and colleagues characterize genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in a collection of 1,307 worldwide Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from the Regional Mapping (RegMap) panel, a publicly available genomic resource that includes large regional panels. They characterize signatures of selection and patterns of recombination and identify an enrichment of hotspots in intergenic regions and in repetitive DNA.},
